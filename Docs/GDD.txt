RACES
===
Some number of laps, and there is a max top-speed, which we gradually climb towards, each consecutive lap.

Once top-speed lap has completed, an exit ramp opens up to move on to the next race.

But you can choose not to take it yet and try to keep driving around to pick up unclaimed collectables to
help yourself more. (inspired by NT here)

Each lap, you are forced into changing your main ability

Different races could cater to different car types? so overall there is no clear "best class". 
Speaking of which...

===
CLASSES
===
What rogue legacy (RL) and nuclear throne (NT) have in common.
Like in RL, you could have a spread of 2-3 or classes to choose from in your heir, with some slight
property variance intra-class. Can't choose to re-use a previous racer though.
But unlike in RL, but like in NT, you unlock new classes through playing and getting further?
Each class should be based around at least one core interesting trade-off

---
Property groups that affect class:
Car Shape (maybe makes some maneuvers easier/even possible)
Weight?
Handling - turn, grip, etc
Off-Road Handling
Braking Ability
Defensive Ability

Class Ideas
 - Stock (base starting class, all-arounder)
 - Off-Road truck (kind of larger, good off-road handling, maybe a bit slow, damage resistant)
 - Dragster (thin, high speed/accel, track: high grip/low turn, offroad: low grip/high turn, excellent braking, can't drift?, damage resistant?)
 - Catamaran (wide, big, maybe high accel?, good braking? handles certain terrain like bumps well?, damage resistant?)
 - ATV - smaller, better turn and accel, good off-road handling, takes way more damage
 - UTV - Handles like Stock, except high off-road stats and takes more damage
 - SuperCar - High Speed, High Accel, High Turn, all-rounder in size/shape, excellent braking
 - SUV - Damage Resistant, good turn, mid shape profile, slightly good off-road handling
 - Rally Car - great off-road, high turn, low track grip, no bumps damage?

ABILITIES
===
much like your weapons in NT and spells in RL
except, you get a new random one each lap

---
jump - discrete amount of uses. jump over pits, rocks, terrain, off-road
brake - hold button to use fluid amount. collectables of "brake juice" scattered around/in destructibles
grappling hook - grapple rocks, trees, bumpers anything else?
projectile - blow up trees and rocks and other? (maybe takes two shots)
bombs - lay down and manually explode one at a time - blows up rocks, trees, bumpers?, sets oil/leaves/logs on fire
projectile bombs
bullet bill (auto-drive) - always nice in a variety of situations
shield - protect from damage - there ought be lots of ways to take damage
saw blades out the sides? - cut down trees, put out fires?

===
OBSTACLES
===
Every obstacle is ideally affectable by every active ability
Most/all can damage the player car in some way.

---
all off-road - damages the player
trees - speed threshold damage, grapple-able, shoot-able, bomb-able
rocks - speed threshold damage, grapple-able, shoot-able, bomb-able
bumpers? (+ moving ones?), just bounce the player
guardrails - along sides of track. self-explanatory
"pits" - large burst of damage if fallen into? (resurrect, think lakitu in mario kart) 
  -(maybe its more like a triggerable spike? juts out when driven over, so it can later be shot w/ projectiles)
barrels/crates - if hit slow, just get pushed around, but if hit fast enough, they break and drop xp
terrain 
	dirt - slows down, hard to grip depending on tires 
	oil - hard to grip, gets set on fire
	bumps - steering weirdness, a little slowdown, light damage?
	leaves/twigs/long grass? - gets set on fire

===
POWER-UPS
===
like mutations in NT
collect xp collectables around the track, 
when leveled up, get a choice

---
jump 
  -midair influence-ability
  -height (maybe obstacles can have discrete, obvious heights)
  -distance
brake juice 
  -amount per lap
  -more juice collectables
grappling hook 
  -distance
  -grabber width
projectile
  -ammo
  -projectile size
  -range
  -rate of fire?
bombs
  -explosion radius
  -non-fire generating?
bullet bill
  -length of time
  -uses per lap
shield
  -amount per lap
car
  -change car style?
  -upgrade any property, really
misc
  -more xp drops
  -more health drops
